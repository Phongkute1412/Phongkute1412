### WELCOME TO MY PAGE 👋👋👋
My name is Nguyen Tan Phong. I am a Fresher in Java. I graduated from Danang University of Economics, and after 3–4 years of working (when I was still a college student), I realized I like logical things more than abstract things. Also, I have a dream and want to make it come true.<br>
